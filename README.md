# TriviaGame

The goal of this project is to evaluate a personâ€™s capabilities to answers several questions, 
while also having several difficulties forced upon the participant.

In this current state we have included a visual. This visual is based on fractals that appear to make the static image move
this in turn we presume will assistin disorienting the participant, 
print that is in a font color that is not the easiest to read,
and the inclusion of a 60 second timer.

We hope you enjoy the environment we have provided
